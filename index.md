## About

Welcome to **NeurIPS meetup Japan 2021**!
NeurIPS is a flagship conference in machine learning and more general artificial intelligence.
This virtual NeurIPS meetup aims to bring together students, researchers, and engineers who are related to or interested in these topics for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.
Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in machine learning are encouraged to attend.

This meetup is going to be held in Japan Standard Time during the NeurIPS conference.
Our official languages are **English and Japanese**.
For this year's meetup event, we will 
- stream NeurIPS keynote **talks**, as well as talks by our invited speakers and authors from institutions in Japan;
- provide a **social venue** for researchers and practitioners to meet fellow participants and build local communities;
- launch a **poster session** for participants to explain and promote their work to a wider audience, and engage in technical and professional conversations in a positive and supportive environment;
- host a **mentoring session** for participants to discuss current research trends and career choices with our invited mentors from industry and academia;
- run a **panel discussion** to discuss the applications and futures of machine learning;
- organize a **women in machine learning** event for women researchers and engineers to interact with each other, find support, and build more technical confidence.
Please join us!
