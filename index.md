## About

Welcome to **NeurIPS meetup Japan 2021**!
NeurIPS is a flagship conference in machine learning and more general artificial intelligence.
This virtual meetup aims to bring together students, researchers, and engineers who are related to or interested in these topics for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.

This meetup is going to be held in Japan Standard Time during the NeurIPS conference.
We will stream NeurIPS keynote **talks**, as well as talks by our invited speakers and authors from institutions in Japan.
The **socials** are designed to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to meet fellow participants, explain and promote their work to a wider audience, and engage in substantive technical and professional conversions in a positive and supportive environment.
There will also be a **mentoring session** for participants to discuss current research trends and career choices with our invited mentors from industry and academia.
Please join us!
