## About

Welcome to **NeurIPS meetup Japan 2021**!
NeurIPS is a flagship conference in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
This virtual meetup aims to bring together students, researchers, and engineers who are related to or interested in these topics for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other.

This meetup is going to be held in Japan Standard Time during the NeurIPS conference.
In addition to the NeurIPS keynote talks, we will broadcast **talks** by invited speakers and authors from institutions in Japan.
The **socials** are designed to provide a platform for researchers to explain and disseminate their work to a wider audience and for practitioners to learn state-of-the-art theories and algorithms.
There will also be a **mentoring session** for participants to discuss the current research trends and career choices in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Please join us!
