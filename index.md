## About

Welcome to NeurIPS meetup Japan 2021! NeurIPS is a flagship conference of machine learning, computational neuroscience, and their applications. This virtual meetup aims to bring together students, researchers, and engineers related to or interested in these topics for an opportunity to connect, exchange ideas, and learn from each other. The meetup is going to be held in Japan Standard Time during the NeurIPS conference. In addition to the NeurIPS keynote talks, we will broadcast talks by invited speakers and authors from institutions in Japan. There will also be a mentoring session for our participants to discuss the current research trends and career choices in the machine learning and broader artificial intelligence field. Please join us!
