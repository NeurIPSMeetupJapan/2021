title: Women in Machine Learning (WiML)
---

The WiML session aims to help women and gender minority individuals working in data science or machine learning build their technical confidence and their voice, and create opportunities for participants to engage in professional conversations in a positive, supportive environment.
We invite guests from both academia and industry to talk about their experiences and hope more people can join and share their stories and get to hear others' stories.
While all guest speakers will identify as a woman, people of all gender identities are invited to attend.
