title: Explanation in Machine Learning and Its Reliability
speaker: Satoshi Hara 
affiliation: Osaka University
---

**Abstract**

Reliability is a fundamental concern when implementing machine learning models to real-world problems. One typical concern regarding reliability is the black-box nature of complex machine learning models, which hinders us from understanding how the models make decisions. In the last few years, several methods for explaining the modelsâ€™ decisions are developed aiming at overcoming this black-box problem. However, recent studies revealed that these explanation methods themselves can be not fully reliable. In this talk, I introduce some topics on reliability issues on the existing explanation methods, both from technical and social perspectives.
