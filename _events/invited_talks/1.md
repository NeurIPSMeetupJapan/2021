title: Explanation in Machine Learning and Its Reliability

### Abstract

Reliability is a fundamental concern when implementing machine learning models to real-world problems. One typical concern regarding reliability is the black-box nature of complex machine learning models, which hinders us from understanding how the models make decisions. In the last few years, several methods for explaining the models’ decisions are developed aiming at overcoming this black-box problem. However, recent studies revealed that these explanation methods themselves can be not fully reliable. In this talk, I introduce some topics on reliability issues on the existing explanation methods, both from technical and social perspectives.
